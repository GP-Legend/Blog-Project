# Blog-Project
A small practice program that allows the user to create and upload blog articles, along with the ability for others to make comments... So long as you're on the same computer.

In order to run this application, download the .zip file and unzip it in the directory of your choosing. From there, make sure that you have Ruby on Rails installed onto your
device. Navigate to the Terminal or Command Line and visit the directory where you unzipped the file that was downloaded. Using Ruby on Rails, start a web server from within the folder
in the Command Line or Terminal using the command 'bin/rails server'. Once the server has been started, open your favorite web browser and type in localhost:3000. Once all of thse steps
have been completed, voila! You have your own blog application.
