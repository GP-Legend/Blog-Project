<!--The following applies to the 'div' below:To finish up, we will add a select
box to the forms, and let the user select the status when they create a new
article or post a new comment. We can also specify the default status as public.
In app/views/articles/_form.html.erb, we can add: -->
  <div>
    <%= form.label :status%><br>
    <%= form.select :status, ['public', 'private', 'archived'], selected: 'public' %>
  </div>

  <div>
    <%= form.submit %>
  </div>
<% end %>

<!--The above code is the same as our form in app/views/articles/new.html.erb,
except that all occurrences of @article have been replaced with article.
Because partials are shared code, it is best practice that they do not depend on
specific instance variables set by a controller action. Instead, we will pass
the article to the partial as a local variable.

A partial's filename must be prefixed with an underscore, e.g. _form.html.erb.
But when rendering, it is referenced without the underscore, e.g. render "form".
