  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "article"=>{"title"=>"Some News", "body"=>"Today, I am going to make an article that hopefully is a little longer than usual. You see, so far they have all been very short and I was hoping that this next one that I am about to create will be much longer in terms of content than all of the other articles combined. Yes, this includes articles that I have deleted, of which there have been at least twenty. Usually they are only a couple of words long, but this time I am going to make it so that there might just be several paragraphs! On the subject of paragraphs, there is a bit of a problem. You see, the way that the articles are formatted, you cannot really see paragraphs. Even if you press the 'Enter' key a bunch of times, you still get everything on 'one' line in that there are no breaks of any sort. You just end up with a wall of text! I have yet to get to the bottom of this issue, but when I do it will be the very last problem that I take care of concerning this application. While it really isn't that important because no one will actually be reading these articles, it is still important that the issue is resolved so that, should I put this into a portfolio of some sort, the whole thing can look at least presentable. As of right now I'd say that things are looking pretty good, so long as I have the color scheme of the application under control.\n\n\nI have typed a lot (just tried to make a new paragraph, we'll see if it actually works), now to hit that 'Create Article' button and see if this thing actually covers the entire screen or not!", "status"=>"public"}, "commit"=>"Update Article", "id"=>"30"}

  Parameters: {"authenticity_token"=>"[FILTERED]", "article"=>{"title"=>"Some News", "body"=>"Today, I am going to make an article that hopefully is a little longer than usual. You see, so far they have all been very short and I was hoping that this next one that I am about to create will be much longer in terms of content than all of the other articles combined. Yes, this includes articles that I have deleted, of which there have been at least twenty. Usually they are only a couple of words long, but this time I am going to make it so that there might just be several paragraphs! On the subject of paragraphs, there is a bit of a problem. You see, the way that the articles are formatted, you cannot really see paragraphs. Even if you press the 'Enter' key a bunch of times, you still get everything on 'one' line in that there are no breaks of any sort. You just end up with a wall of text! I have yet to get to the bottom of this issue, but when I do it will be the very last problem that I take care of concerning this application. While it really isn't that important because no one will actually be reading these articles, it is still important that the issue is resolved so that, should I put this into a portfolio of some sort, the whole thing can look at least presentable. As of right now I'd say that things are looking pretty good, so long as I have the color scheme of the application under control.\n\n\nI have typed a lot (just tried to make a new paragraph, we'll see if it actually works), now to hit that 'Create Article' button and see if this thing actually covers the entire screen or not!", "status"=>"public"}, "commit"=>"Update Article", "id"=>"30"}
